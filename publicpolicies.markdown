#Public Policies

Local Law 11, specifically § 23-502 d, requires that data sets must be available without registration requirement, license requirement, or usage restrictions, except as provided below.

##Explicit Identification of Public Use by Third Parties

DoITT may require third party entities such as application developers to explicitly identify the source, version, and modifications made to a public data set, should they publicly re-publish it elsewhere or incorporate the public data set into an application. This is addressed through updated Terms of Use for the NYC OpenData portal.

##Terms of Use

The following Terms of Use apply to visitors to the NYC OpenData portal and application developers who obtain City data through this single web portal:
By accessing data sets and feeds available through the NYC OpenData portal (or the "Site"), the user agrees to all of the [Terms of Use of NYC.gov](http://www.nyc.gov/html/misc/html/tou.html) as well as the [NYC.gov Privacy Policy](http://www.nyc.gov/privacy). The user also agrees to any additional terms of use defined by entities providing data or feeds through the Site. Entities providing data include, without limitation, agencies, bureaus, offices, departments and other discrete entities of the City of New York ("City"). Public data sets made available on the NYC OpenData portal are provided for informational purposes. The City does not warranty the completeness, accuracy, content, or fitness for any particular purpose or use of any public data set made available on the NYC OpenData portal, nor are any such warranties to be implied or inferred with respect to the public data sets furnished therein.

The City is not liable for any deficiencies in the completeness, accuracy, content, or fitness for any particular purpose or use of any public data set, or application utilizing such data set, provided by any third party.
Submitting City Agencies are the authoritative source of data available on NYC OpenData. These entities are responsible for data quality and retain version control of data sets and feeds accessed on the Site. Data may be updated, corrected, overwritten and/or refreshed at any time. The anticipated update frequency is indicated for each data set on the Site. Older versions of data sets will not be retained.

##Ensuring Continued Public Access to Data Sets

DoITT may implement rate-limiting on a per-visitor basis to ensure that the NYC OpenData portal’s system resources are shared fairly between all visitors.

##Protecting the NYC OpenData Portal

DoITT may implement rate-limiting and other security mechanisms to ensure that the NYC OpenData portal is not abused, damaged, or impaired.

##Improving Service Delivery

DoITT may implement registration capabilities in order to gather usage metrics, particularly for third-party applications which routinely access the NYC OpenData portal. In addition, the developers of third-party applications will benefit from receiving updates from DoITT as enhancements to the site and the data it contains are applied over time.

The goal is to improve the way the NYC OpenData portal functions and the data available through it, by using registration only to ensure access to public data sets, to protect the single web site housing public data sets from unlawful abuse or attempts to damage or impair use of the web site, or to analyze the types of data being used to improve service delivery.
